We will provide you with a dataset to improve by applying data-centric techniques  
such as fixing incorrect labels, adding examples that represent edge cases, apply data augmentation, etc.  

Contestants must submit their altered dataset for evaluation by September 4, 2021.

## Submission Process
In this tutorial, we will cover the process of submitting your dataset and results for official evaluation on the Data-Centric AI Competition

Once your dataset has been evaluated officially, your scores will be added to the leaderboard. Before we begin, please create a `CodaLab Worksheets account`.  
Be sure to create a `CodaLab Worksheets account`, not to be confused with a standard CodaLab account.
